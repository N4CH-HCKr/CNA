# CNA
 Repository of my preparation for the OSCP and everything related to ethical hacking -- Thanks to CODE SPACE, especially to my tutorS David Reguera (DREG) and Enrique Lauroba.
 
 In this repository I will add posts and files from my preparation for the OSCP and everything related to CNA.

 I am trying to improve my English so there are possibly mistakes in my writing.
 Any corrections or improvements will be welcome.
 On the other hand, I will write the articles in both Spanish and English. According to the desire and the moment in which I find myself.

**I hope you like it**
